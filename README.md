# Support_vector_Regression
A simple model of a Support Vector Regression.The model is trained on Salaries data and since the data is inherently exponential the Support Vector Regression has results close to Polynomial Regression.The Support Vector Regression can be imported from sklearn.svm.The svr has many Kernel options like 'linear','polynomial','rbf','sigmoid','precomputed'.The kernel once intialized with different options is able to Provide good predicitons based on the options and Kernel.The default value being 'rbf' which is the Gassuin kernel.Once all packages are Downloaded the Model runs smoothly.This can also server as a basic indicator as to which type of model can  be a good estimator of data.Support Vector Regression estimates the data baesd on wether it is within the margin or not and takes a descision.Support Vector Regression support Non-Linear-Regression.
